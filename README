#These files are meant as simple demonstrations of detector concepts

alphas.py	
Plots in terminal alpha hit patterns on array, applies THL and clusters	Uses clusteringClass.py

parameters.py	
Runs simulation of alphas on array, clusters and saves parameters of each event to root file: signal, size, sizeX, sizeY, multiplicity	Uses clusteringClass.py

clusteringClass.py	
Class of functions used by alphas.py and parameters.py	

planes.py	
Simulation of hits on arrays with front, side projection and top projection displayed - like telescope	

diffusion.py	
1D diffusion simulation	

bulkVis.py	
3D simulation of diffusion of charge in bulk, displayed on 6 faces of cube	
(In Progress)
